# 🎯 Problem Statement – AI Study Planner
### 1. User Description

Students who struggle with planning their study schedules, managing multiple subjects, and balancing workloads across weeks. These users want a simple tool that automatically organizes their topics, computes study hours, and builds a revision-friendly plan.

### 2. Pain Points

-Difficulty managing time across different subjects

-Forgetting to include revision for difficult topics

-No structured workflow for planning studies week by week

-Manually creating timetables is time-consuming and confusing

-Not knowing how to balance difficulty, time availability, and priority

### 3. Why This Matters

A well-organized study plan leads to:

-Better time management

-Reduced academic stress

-Higher productivity

-More effective learning and retention

-Clear visibility of daily/weekly commitments

Students often lose marks not due to lack of intelligence, but due to poor planning.
This app solves that.

### 4. MVP Goal

Build an AI-driven study planner that:

-Takes topics + difficulty

-Takes available hours weekly

-Generates a personalized study schedule

-Adds extra revision sessions for difficult topics

-Exports the plan to CSV

-Summarizes the weekly plan and learning goals

This MVP focuses on automation + personalization, not complex AI models.

### 5. Scope (In-Scope for MVP)

✔ User inputs list of topics

✔ User assigns difficulty level (1–5)

✔ User enters available hours for each day

✔ Automatically generated study schedule

✔ Revision sessions for difficult topics

✔ CSV export of final plan

✔ Clean UI built using Streamlit

### 6. Out of Scope (Not included in MVP)

✘ AI predictions for study outcomes

✘ Syncing with Google Calendar / Outlook

✘ Machine learning-based difficulty estimation

✘ Multi-user accounts or authentication

✘ Real-time collaboration features

✘ Mobile app version

### 7. Assumptions

-User is studying alone (single user)

-User will provide honest difficulty levels

-User has a reasonably consistent weekly availability

-Time slot distribution is based on hours input, not exact times

-Revision is triggered only when difficulty ≥ 3
